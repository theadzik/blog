## About me

I am a DevOps Engineer with broad experience across all DevOps-related topics.
I feel strongest in **Kubernetes** and **Azure Cloud**, specializing in designing and implementing secure, cost-effective cloud solutions.
I also have solid knowledge of **AWS** and am always exploring new cloud technologies and infrastructure approaches.

Passionate about **Everything as Code**, I focus on optimizing performance, reliability,
and financial efficiency across systems.

My expertise includes **platform engineering**, leveraging **Terraform** for infrastructure-as-code, **Python** for automation and tooling,
and **GitHub Workflows** for CI/CD pipelines.

In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with my homelab Kubernetes cluster running on **Talos Linux**,
using it as a hands-on platform to test new ideas and host various applications—including this blog.
My cluster infrastructure uses **ArgoCD** for GitOps, **Helm**, and **Kustomize** for application management.
This hobby reflects my commitment to continuous learning and technical excellence beyond my professional work.

## Other achievements

### Making the (kubernetes) world more secure

In January 2022, while working on a project using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) I found a security vulnerability
in [azurefile CSI driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurefile-csi-driver/tree/master).
It allowed abusing a caching mechanism to gain unauthorized access to data
on file shares mounted in another namespace. A serious risk, especially in multi-tenant clusters.

It was assigned a **High Severity** rating and I was awarded $9000 in Microsoft's bug bounty program.

### KubeCon Europe 2025 Capture The Flag (CTF)

At my first KubeCon, I decided to participate in the Capture the Flag (CTF) event.
The organizer encouraged teamwork, so our table of three joined forces.
We successfully exploited an unprotected OCI registry, analyzed compromised pods by reviewing [Tetragon logs](https://tetragon.io/),
and ultimately opened a reverse shell from an unprotected website.
As a result, we finished in the top 8 out of 138 participants!

The challenges are nicely described [here](https://www.skybound.link/2025/04/kubecon-eu-2025-ctf-writeup/).
You can also spot **Houssem**, **TOLF**, and myself (**adzik**) in the screenshot of the leaderboard.

## Education

### University of Gdańsk
#### Bachelor's Degree, Computer Science

During my time at University of Gdańsk I learnt many skills that have I use throughout my career
such as computer architecture, networking and programming to list a few.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I like messing around with my personal Kubernetes cluster.
I use it to host things like a password manager, a DNS server, and this blog.
You can check out the code on [theadzik/homelab](https://github.com/theadzik/homelab).

On a different note, I'm a big Formula 1 fan and have been watching since 2006.
I got to attend the Austrian Grand Prix in 2019, and it was awesome!
