Just saying hello :)

<!-- truncate -->

Since I bought a Raspberry Pi and set up a Kubernetes "cluster" on it,
my homelab has become my main hobby.
I spend a lot of time making sure everything is secure, automated, and reliable.
It's also a place for me to experiment with different tools and technologiesâ€”
to build and break things in ways I could never do in an enterprise environment at work.

During my journey, I've used many different sources: social media for inspiration,
product documentation for technical details, and blogs or articles for quick how-to's.
I hope to contribute to the latter. Maybe someone will find this site and its content useful.
I'll be happy even if just one person does.
